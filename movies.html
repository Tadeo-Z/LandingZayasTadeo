    <h1>Here I will show some of my favorite movies & series</h1>
    <h2>
        I really struggle to watch movies or TV shows. I mean, it's rare that I just say to myself, 
        "I'm going to watch this movie/TV show," even when people recommend something to me, 
        it usually takes me a long time to get around to watching it. Even so, I've obviously seen a 
        lot of TV shows and movies, you can see my favorites below.

            I watched this movie in 2020 while I was on vacation about to enter college. Due to problems
             at home and in my personal life, this movie, despite being quite raw, really helped me out
              when I watched it. I even learned a little from it.

            <h3>47 Ronin</h3>

        <p>
            While this movie adds fantastical elements and things that didn't happen to a real event, 
            I love the plot, I love the pace of the movie, and I love Keanu Reeves' acting as a 
            "half-breed Samurai." It may not be the best movie in the world, but it's special to me.

            This movie has a particular detail about it. I know that the plot doesn't make any sense 
            and is often inconsistent, but despite that, I can't help but like it so much and from 
            time to time I will watch it again.

            <h3>Pacific Rim</h3>

            I remember seeing this movie when it came out in theaters. I was so excited because it 
            was about giant robots fighting monsters that came out of the ocean. I was probably too 
            young to understand the weight of the plot, but as the years went by, I stopped liking 
            it just for being a "Monsters vs. Robots" movie and started to like it more for the plot
            of the main characters.

        <li>
            <h3>Breaking bad</h3>

            I only started watching this series last year, and I haven't even finished it yet, 
            but it's already my absolute favorite without a doubt. The plot is excellent, the 
            characters are well-written, and the actors are fantastic in their roles. I think 
            it's a gem of a series, no matter how you look at it.

        <li>
            <h3>Squid game</h3>
            <img src="img/series/squid game.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="350">

        <p>
            I watched this series a few months after it came out, I remember not being able to
            stop watching it the moment I started. I watched all nine episodes in just two days,
            which is a record considering that when I watch a series, I usually only watch one or 
            two episodes a day. Since I finished it, I've been eagerly awaiting the second season,
            but the series director said it would take as long as it needed. I'm not complaining 
            as long as a second season comes out with the same or better quality than the first.

            <h3>Lupin</h3>

            I started watching this series with a friend one time when we had a sleepover at 
            another friend's house in the same group. The series is about a very intelligent
            French thief who is also an excellent gentleman. The plot has twists, unexpected 
            elements, and even cliffhangers. I highly recommend it - it's very entertaining 
            and great for having a good time watching something.

            <h3>Arcane</h3>

            Arcane, a series created by Riot Games in 2021. I remember not watching
            it until 2022, but as soon as I did, I had a similar experience to when I 
            watched Squid Game. I was completely hooked and watched all the episodes 
            in just two days. The script, the pace of the series, the characters, the 
            voice actors - everything is perfect in this series. It's a series that I 
            recommend to all my gamer friends.
